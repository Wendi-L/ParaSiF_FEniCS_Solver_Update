# ParaSiF FEniCS Solver Update

## Overview

This is a working space on the mini-project of ParaSiF FEniCS solver update. 

It includes two parts:
* Code clean-up/optimisation.
This part aims to clean-up and optimise the ParaSiF FEniCS in terms of its ease of read for collebration and long term maintaince. It will based on FEniCS-v2019.1.0.

* FEniCS-v2019 -> FEniCS-X transfer.
This part aims to transfer the code from FEniCS-v2019.1.0 to FEniCS-X-v0.5.1+, by using the updated APIs and new features in FEniCS-X.

## Branching Strategy

* main

Contains the original code and benchmark case during the work. It will contain the final code to be merged into ParaSiF once this piece of work finished.

* FEniCS-v2019

This is the branch on the code clean-up/optimisation activities.

* FEniCS-X

This is the branch on the FEniCS-X transfer. It will be created once code clean-up/optimisation activities done.
